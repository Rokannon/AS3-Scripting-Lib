#summary Instructions for defining the scope object (this)

= Introduction =

By default, scripts run in scope of the global object. Often, it's desirable to have scripts run in the scope of a different object. For instance, browsers run JavaScript in the scope of the DOM's Window object.

= Details =

The scope for a script can be defined using a `ScriptContext` object as the second argument of calls to `ICompiler.compile()` and `ICompiler.compileAndLoad()`. The first argument of the `ScriptContext` constructor is a reference to the desired scope object. The second argument determines whether object proxies should be used (true by default, false for this example).

Assuming an instance of an initialized `ICompiler` already exists (Flash or Flex):

{{{
import com.newgonzo.scripting.ICompiler;
import com.newgonzo.scripting.ScriptContext;

// assuming we want our script to run in the scope of some Date object
var scope:Object = new Date();
var script:String = "trace(this);";
var context:ScriptContext = new ScriptContext(scope, false);

compiler.compileAndLoad(script, context);

// traces "[object Date]"
