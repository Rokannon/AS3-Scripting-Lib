#summary Instructions for defining the scope object (this)

= Introduction =

By default, scripts run in scope of the global object. Often, it's desirable to have scripts run in the scope of a different object. For instance, browsers run JavaScript in the scope of the DOM's Window object.

= Details =

The scope for a script can be defined using a ScriptContext object as the second argument of calls to ICompiler.compile() and ICompiler.compileAndLoad(). The first argument of the ScriptContext constructor is a reference to the desired scope object. The second argument determines whether object proxies should be used (true by default, false for this example).

Assuming an instance of an initialized ICompiler already exists (Flash or Flex):

{{{
import com.newgonzo.scripting.ICompiler;
import com.newgonzo.scripting.ScriptContext;

// assuming we want our script to run in the scope of some Date object
var scope:Object = new Date();
var script:String = "trace(this);";
var context:ScriptContext = new ScriptContext(scope, false);

compiler.compileAndLoad(script, context);

// traces "[object Date]"
